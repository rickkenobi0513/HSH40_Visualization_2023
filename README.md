The final project of 2241 INFSCI 2415 SEC1010 INFORMATION VISUALIZATION
# The final project
## Title: Exploring Film Dynamics: Budget, Revenue, Ratings, and Runtimes
### This project is mainly focused on the effects that movie data can have on boxoffice. The source data came from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
### The mainly used plot function is plotly framework, and the language is Python. Please note that some of the plots in the main file are _NOT_ included in the final report. I just made those during the process of determining which plots are more informative.
